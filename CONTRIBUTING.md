## Add Apache license header to all new classes

```java
/*
 * Copyright 2014 the original author or authors.
 *
 * Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the "License");
 * you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.
 * You may obtain a copy of the License at
 *
 *      http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0

 */

package ...;
```

## Update Apache license header to modified files as necessary

Always check the date range in the license header. For example, if you've
modified a file in 2014 whose header still reads.

```java
 * Copyright 2013 the original author or authors.
```

then be sure to update it to 2014 appropriately.

```java
 * Copyright 2013-2014 the original author or authors.
```

## Use @since tags for newly-added public API types and methods

e.g.

```java
/**
 * ...
 *
 * @author First Last
 * @since JDK1.6
 * @since commons.lang3
 * @since ...
 * @see ...
 */
```

## Use //~ tags for fields,Constructors,methods
These can appear only once.
e.g.
```java
//~ Instance fields ==================================================

/**
 * 
 */
...
```
```java
//~ Constructors ==================================================

/**
 * ${tags}
 */
...
```
```java

//~ Methods ==================================================

/**
 * ${tags}
 */
....
```


## Submit JUnit test cases for all behavior changes
Search the codebase to find related unit tests and add additional @Test methods.
