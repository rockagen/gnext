GNEXT
=====

Generic integrated base framework.

####what's this?
Integrated some java popular frameworks and encapsulate some very efficient class

So,you can quickly develop and custom based `gnext` without worry about how to build a generic architecture.

###how-to
As mentioned above,`gnext` just a base generic  framework, your can based `gnext` add and change instead of writing some boring code,so clone `gnext` to your project,and custom it depending on your project needs

Now,`gnext` integrated `spring` series,`hibernate` series and more and more frameworks will be integrated in the future version.


###example
- Use `Conf.get(key)` instead of properties file(
update key-value by a scheduled task from database,and performance is not bad).
- spring-security complex extension example.
- be able to complete complicated feature by writing a few code and data.
- clone it,maybe your solution.
